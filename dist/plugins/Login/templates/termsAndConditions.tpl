Subscriber agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement
(&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;).</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; <strong>License.</strong> Your right to use the Service is
subject to this Agreement and is made subject to the GNU General
Public License version 3 pursuant to which the software underlying
the Service is provided. OpenRoad may from time to time modify or
enhance the Service without notice to you. Your access to the

account for OpenRoad's ThoughtFarmer software expires or is
otherwise terminated.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; <strong>Subscriber's Account.</strong> Subscriber is
responsible for all access to the Service by Subscriber's personnel
or designated Users, whether or not Subscriber has knowledge of or
authorizes such use.</p>

is not responsible for compliance with Subscriber&rsquo;s internal
policies, regardless of whether it has notice of them.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; <strong>Term.</strong> OpenRoad may in its sole discretion
